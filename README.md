# Target Audience
TradingAppPP5 is designed for traders and investors who need a comprehensive platform to manage their trades, track market trends, and make informed decisions. The application aims to provide a user-friendly interface that caters to both beginners and experienced traders.

# Design
### Research
Conducted market analysis of existing trading platforms (e.g., OfferUp, Facebook Marketplace)

Identified main points:

- Lack of secure messaging in local trading apps

- Poor item discovery based on location

- No built-in reputation systems

### Fonts
Primary Font: Roboto
Secondary Font: Lato
Structure
The application follows a clean and intuitive structure, with a focus on usability and accessibility. The main sections include:

Dashboard: Overview of user activities and market trends.
- Trade Management: Tools for managing trades and portfolios.
- User Profile: Personalized settings and preferences.
- messagin inbox: Inbox for managing conversations.

# Deployment

## App Deployment
For deploying your app, **Render** is used. Follow these steps:

### Backend Deployment (Django)

#### **1. Create a New Web Service**
- Go to the [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/).
- Click **New Web Service** and connect your GitHub repository.

#### **2. Configure the Service**
- Choose **Python** as the environment.
- Set the **Build Command** to:
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python manage.py migrate
  ```
- Set the **Start Command** to:
  ```sh
  gunicorn project_name.wsgi:application
  ```

#### **3. Set Environment Variables**
- In the "Environment" section, add the following variables:
  - `DATABASE_URL` ‚Üí PostgreSQL database URL (Render provides one if using its database service).
  - `SECRET_KEY` ‚Üí A strong secret key for Django.
  - `CLOUDINARY_URL` ‚Üí If using Cloudinary for media storage.

#### **4. Configure PostgreSQL Database (Optional)**
- If you need a database, create a **New PostgreSQL Database** in Render.
- Copy the **Database URL** and add it to the environment variables.

#### **5. Allow Hosts & Static Files**
- In `settings.py`, set:
  ```python
  ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['your-render-app.onrender.com']
  ```
- Configure static files:
  ```python
  STATIC_URL = '/static/'
  STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
  ```

#### **6. Deploy**
- Click **Create Web Service** and wait for the deployment to complete.

---

### Frontend Deployment (React)

#### **1. Create a New Static Site**
- In the Render Dashboard, click **New Static Site**.
- Connect your React repository.

#### **2. Configure the Service**
- Set the **Build Command** to:
  ```sh
  npm install && npm run build
  ```
- Set the **Publish Directory** to:
  ```sh
  build
  ```

#### **3. Add Environment Variables (Optional)**
- If using environment variables in React, add them in the Render Dashboard under **Environment**.

#### **4. Deploy**
- Click **Create Static Site** and wait for the deployment.

---

## Version Control
To manage version control and push code to GitHub, follow these steps:

#### **1. Add Changes**
```sh
git add .
```

#### **2. Commit Changes**
```sh
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

#### **3. Push to GitHub**
```sh
git push origin main
```

---

### Notes:
- Render automatically redeploys when you push changes to GitHub.
- Monitor logs in the Render dashboard for debugging deployment issues.
- Set up a custom domain in Render if needed.

Your Django backend and React frontend should now be successfully deployed on Render!
